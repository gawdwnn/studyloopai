‚ö° Performance Optimization Opportunities

Database Performance

1. N+1 Query Issues

- Problem: updateGoldenNote queries course separately for each note
- Fix: Batch queries or use RLS-only approach for authorization

2. Missing Indexes

- Problem: No composite indexes for common query patterns
- Fix: Add indexes for (courseId, weekId), (userId, courseId)

combinations 3. Large JSON Processing - Problem: Tag filtering done in JavaScript rather than SQL - Location: own-notes.ts:178-185 - Fix: Use PostgreSQL JSONB operators for filtering

Client-Side Performance

4. Bundle Size

- Issue: Heavy markdown editor dependencies (MDEditor + jsPDF)
- Fix: Implement dynamic imports for export functionality

5. Re-render Optimization

- Issue: Notes list re-renders on every search keystroke
- Fix: Optimize search debouncing and memoization

6. Memory Leaks
