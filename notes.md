- Fix: Add loading indicators for all async operations

5. Empty State Design

- Good: Descriptive empty states for notes tabs

⚡ Performance Optimization Opportunities

Database Performance

1. N+1 Query Issues

- Problem: updateGoldenNote queries course separately for each note
- Fix: Batch queries or use RLS-only approach for authorization

2. Missing Indexes ✅ VERIFIED

- Problem: No composite indexes for common query patterns
- ✅ VERIFIED: Schema already has proper composite indexes in place:
  - idx_own_notes_course_week (courseId, weekId)
  - idx_own_notes_user_course (userId, courseId)
- Individual field indexes also implemented for optimal query performance

combinations 3. Large JSON Processing ✅ FIXED - Problem: Tag filtering done in JavaScript rather than SQL - Location: own-notes.ts:178-185 - ✅ FIXED: Replaced JS tag filtering with PostgreSQL JSONB @> operators - Performance improved by moving filtering to database level - Proper SQL joins for tag conditions

Client-Side Performance

5. Re-render Optimization

- Issue: Notes list re-renders on every search keystroke
- Fix: Optimize search debouncing and memoization

6. Memory Leaks

- Risk: Fullscreen event listeners not properly cleaned up
- Fix: Add proper cleanup in useEffect dependencies
